    "On this homework, you will train spam message generator, which is basic RNN/LSTM/GRU char2char generation model. Of course, your results may not so good, but you can expect some sentence-like results by doing this homework sucessfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Now, We'll handle texts, not images. Is there any differences?\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, there are many differences between processing images and texts. One is that text cannot be expressed directly in matrices or tensors. We know an image can be expressed in Tensor(n_channel, width, height). But how about an text sentence? Can word 'Homework' can be expressed in tensor directly? By what laws? With what shapes? Even if it can, which one is closer to the word, 'Burden', or 'Work'? This is called 'Word Embedding Problem' and be considered as one of the most important problem in Natural Language Process(NLP) resarch. Fortunatly, there are some generalized solution in this problem (though not prefect, anyway) and both Tensorflow and Pytorch give basic APIs that solve this problem automatically. You may use those APIs in this homework. \n",
    "\n",
    "The other one is that text is sequential data. Generally, when processing images, without batch, input is just one image. However in text, input is mostly some or one paragraphs/sentences, which is sequential data of embedded character or words. So, If we want to generate word 'Homework' with start token 'H', 'o' before 'H' and 'o' before 'Homew' should operate different when it gives to input. This is why we use RNN-based model in deep learning when processing text data."

I'm using python3.7 on grading environment but there are no major changes on python3.6/8 so also will not be a serious problem. \n",
